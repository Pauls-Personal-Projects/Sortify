# About

Sortify is an app that helps you recycle. In many cases people don’t recycle because it can be hard to know how to dispose of things correctly. Sortify solves this problem by sorting out your recycling for you. Simply take a picture of the item and the app will provide you with recycling instructions.

# Getting Started

The Test Release of the app can be found [here](https://github.com/paulpall/Sortify/releases)! Follow the instructions provided on the page.

# Usage

## Start Screen:

When the app is started you will be faced with two options. Sortify Discover™ that lists all known recyclable objects along with the respective recycling guidances; and Sortify Camera™ that lets the user capture an object & provides relevant information in return.

## Sortify Discover:

In the Discover view the user can scroll up and down to browse through different recyclable items.

## Sortify Camera:

In the Camera view it first goes to the phone's camera to take a picture. Once the picture has been taken the app gives possible items in the picture and how to recycle them.
