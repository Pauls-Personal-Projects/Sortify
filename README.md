# About



Sortify is an app that helps you recycle . In many cases people don’t recycle because it can be hard to know how to dispose of things correctly . Sortify solves this problem by sorting out your recycling for you . Simply take a picture of the item and the app will provide you with recycling instructions .



# Getting Started

The Test Release of the app can be found [here](https://github.com/paulpall/Sortify/releases)! Follow the instructions provided on the page .

# Usage

## Start Screen:

When the app is started you will be faced with two options. Sortify Discover™ that lists all known recyclable objects along with the respective recycling guidances; and Sortify Camera™ that lets the user capture an object & provides relevant information in return.

## Sortify Discover:

In the Discover view the user can scroll up and down to browse through different recyclable items.

## Sortify Camera:

In the Camera view it first goes to the phone's camera to take a picture . Once the picture has been taken the app gives possible items in the picture and how to recycle them .
